<p>Feral cats are domestic cats that have returned to the wild or born in the wild.

The domestic cat has soft fur, a short snout and is widely kept as a pet or for catching mice.

Many breeds of cats have been developed. Today though, we’re talking about the cats that we love to call pets! <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/animals/cat.png" alt="Rabbit with lop ears in barn" width="203"> 
    

The History of Cats
Between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago the Near Eastern wildcat which roamed the deserts of Israel, Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries gave rise to the genes that eventually produced all domesticated cats as we know them today.

It is often difficult or impossible for even the trained eye to tell them apart, which has made studying them really difficult.

The earliest archaeological evidence for domestic cats was found in Cyprus and dates back approximately 9,500 years.<strong> Wow, that’s a long time!</strong>
